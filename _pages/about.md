Graduated in IT in the [University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es/en/), Spain (2010 - 2016), I have since then worked for some of the most important companies in Spain ([Santander Bank](https://www.santander.com/en/), [Telefonica](https://www.telefonica.com/en/), etc...) and some Consulting companies as a System Administrator with some DevOps.

I will try to upload some projects to my [GitHub](https://github.com/slavid) account, the first one of them being this personal site and blog which I will try to update from time to time whenever there is something relevant to write about.

Some of the topics I'm interested in are:

- > Clustering computing with __Kubernetes__ both on bare-metal and on the cloud such as __AWS__ EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) and __Docker__ containerization as well as automating deployments with __CI/CD__ tools such as __Jenkins__ and __GitOps__ deployments..

- > __IaC__ provisioning with __Terraform__.

- > Configuration-Management and task automation with __Ansible__.

- > Linux & Unix administration, __Hypervisor Virtualization__ (VMware ESXi, Xen, KVM), SIEM, etc...

- > __FPGA__ projects such as the [Mister FPGA](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki) project to preserve old arcade systems and retro consoles.

- > Log aggregation and field extraction from many different logs sources and log formats by developping complex parsers using Regular expressions (**regex**) with technologies such as [ArcSight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArcSight) and [Splunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splunk).

- > Playing around with my homelab and keep up to date with new technologies to try to self-host in the forementioned homelab.
